# Minimal Theme (Now with Jekyll!)

## Heads up! Want to use this on GitHub Pages?

Unfortunately GitHub pages doesn't currently support `jekyll-assets` this theme requires. You should like this version better: [bryanculver/minimal-jekyll-ghp](https://github.com/bryanculver/minimal-jekyll-ghp)

[Demo the Theme](https://bryanculver.com/minimal-jekyll/)

This is the raw HTML and styles that are used for the *minimal* theme on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/).

Syntax highlighting is provided on GitHub Pages by [Pygments](http://pygments.org).
